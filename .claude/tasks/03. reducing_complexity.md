If I run pytest, I see three tests failing. Please fix them.

Also, two systems for schedules is really overkill. Please remove legacy one and all tests for it.

We should have only new one. Make sure it works as it should: after you have calculated effective schedule (see `02. multischedules.md`), time and next working day should be calculated as specified in `01. timealgo.md`
