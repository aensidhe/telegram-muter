Thanks a lot!

Now, we've done 3 tasks in `.claude/tasks` folder and there is time for the last task.

Please, write tests for `get_next_working_day` method (it's in telegram_muter.py, line 129). Ideally you shouldn't change the code, but if the testability will require it, please do change.

Tests should make sure that method works as I described before:

1. If time of now is less than `start_of_day` in specified timezone, then `starting day` should be today, else tomorrow.
2. If weekday of `starting day` is specified in the `weekends`, then it is `weekend`, otherwise it is `weekday`.
3. If it is `weekend` and it is specified in `working_weekends`, then is is `weekday`, else we should add 1 day to `starting day` and go to step 2.
4. If it is `weekday` and it is specified in `nonworking_weekdays` (see, this property has a priority over `working_weekends`, because hey, we can go to vacation), then we should add 1 day to `starting day` and go to step 2, else we have found our date.
