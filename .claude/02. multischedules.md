Now I want to add an ability to specify several schedules, where schedule is the combination of `weekends`, `working_weekends` and `nonworking_weekdays`.

For users with one schedule UX should be roughly the same. Schedules should be named, names should be unique and one schedule should have name `default`.

User can also specify parent schedule for any schedule except `default` one.

If property isn't specified in schedule, we should look for it in parent. Schedules can be chained indefinetely.

When this will be done, we need to use it. We will have settings for groups, something like this:

```yaml
- name: "asdfasdf" # name and name_pattern are mutually exclusive settings
  name_pattern: "duty.*" # we can use anything that ok in Python regexp
  schedule: <name>
...
```
So, when we try to mute group we should check settings for groups from top to bottom, trying to find exact match. If we don't have exact match, try to find first matching rule with from top to bottom. If we fail again, use default schedule.

I remind you that we have tests, so for any new and changed functionality we should add or amend tests. Same for docs on both languages.

Finally, this program should be public domain, so create License file and update licensing info everywhere we mentioned it.
