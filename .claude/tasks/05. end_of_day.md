Hi!

At the moment, we're good. I've decided that we need last feature: `end_of_day`. It should be time like `start_of_day`.

The idea is to put `telegram_muter` to cron and it should not mute working chats during work day.

So, we need to:

1. Add setting `end_of_day`.
2. When script runs and time of day (take timezone into account) is between `start_of_day` and `end_of_day` we exit with message `It's working day now, not muting chats` (you can change the message using better English than mine).
3. We should add parameter to `mute` command: `--finish-the-day`. If parameter presents we ignore `end_of_day` setting.

Do not forget to update tests and docs.

Make sure that nothing else in logic changed.

Thanks.
