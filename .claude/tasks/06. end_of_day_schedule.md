We have added `end_of_day` parameter to every schedule, which is correct, but we use it only for default which is not corrent.

We should pass the fact is the `--finish-the-day` set or not to main algorithm. And on level of every chat, after we have got a schedule of the chat, make a decision whether to mute or not based on current time, start and end of the day settings and fact of `--finish-the-day` set.

Also, update tests, please.

And config tool should output all effective schedules, not just default. Thanks.
